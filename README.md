The first week homework. 

I try to build the promotion website of Lego's newly launched product "NASA Space Shuttle Discovery"

The website if offering three pages 1) Home page (index) 2) Deliveries and returns 3) Other Lego Space Series

My question is that:
When we write a code, which is better? 1. making it as short as possible or 2. changing lines and putting comments frequently to make it more readable
